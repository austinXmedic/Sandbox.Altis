player creatediaryrecord ["tier5",["Individual Fighting Positions","
Offensive Positions
<br/>
A good offensive fighting position prioritizes safety over a wide sector of fire.
Wide fields of fire are generally less safe, therefore less effective than protected positions with narrow fields of fire.
Team members should take the most covered positions possible in preparation for an engagement.
<br/><br/>
Defensive Positions
<br/>
Good defensive fighting positions are completely covered from the direction of an attack with sectors of fire oriented to the obliques of the position to prevent exposure to the attacking force.
Defenders should never peek over or around their cover.
When defending, the objective is to hold territory with minimal risk to friendly forces.
"]];

player creatediaryrecord ["Tier5",["Land Navigation","
The Grid Coordinate System
<br/>
Grid coordinates are generally given as four, six, or eight digit numbers.
These numbers represent specific locations on a map.
The first half of the digits are called Easting and are found by moving left to right on the map.
The second half of the digits of a grid coordinate are called Northing and are found by reading upward on the map.
The more digits in a grid coordinate, the more precise the coordinate location.
A four digit grid represents one square kilometer, a six digit grid represents an area of one hundred sqare meters, and an eight digit coordinate represents a ten square meter area.
<br/><br/>
Contour Lines
<br/>
Contour lines are lines drawn on a map to represent points of equal elevation.
These lines are utilized to determine the shape of terrain and identify terrain features on a map.
<br/><br/>
Terrain Features:
<br/>
Knowing and recognizing the following terrain features can greatly ease the burden of navigating unfamiliar terrain.
<br/>
Cliff - A vertical or near vertical slope.
<br/>
Depression - A low point or hole surrounded by higher ground on all sides.
<br/>
Draw - Similar to a valley, except smaller and more constrictive with little or no flat ground.
<br/>
Hill - A point of high ground where ground slopes downward in all directions from the top.
<br/>
Ridge - A line of high ground, where all points are higher than ground on both sides.
<br/>
Saddle - A dip along a ridge crest.
<br/>
Spur - A continuously sloping line of higher ground jutting out from the side of a ridge.
<br/>
Valley - An area of reasonably level ground bordered by higher ground on both sides.

player creatediaryrecord ["tier4",["Bounding","
Bounding is the coordinating of alternate movements between partner elements to allow each to move under support of the other.
As a team, members should be able to effectively bound with each other and with a partner team in order to safely move under fire or threat of fire.
<br/>
Bounding movements may be executed in any direction.
<br/>
Bounding toward an objective is called prograde bounding and is used for attacking.
<br/>
Bounding away from an objective is called retrograde bounding and is used when breaking contact.
<br/>
Bounding left or right relative to an objective is called lateral bounding and is used when seeking positional advantage during a fight.
<br/>
To coordinate a bound, team leaders should communicate with each other and their subordinates to signal the stage of their movement.
<br/><br/>
Execution:
<br/>
1. When the order is given to begin bounding movements or whenever contact is made, elements rush to cover.
<br/><br/>
2. Once in cover, team leaders announce 'set!'
<br/><br/>
3. One of the elements in cover will be given the order to bound.
<br/><br/>
4. The ordered element leader will call 'moving!' to signal his team to move to the nearest covered point in the direction of the bound.
<br/><br/>
5. After sprinting no more than five seconds, the moving element will be in the covered location, have their weapons on line, oriented toward the enemy, and the element leader will announce 'set!'
<br/><br/>
6. The next element will now announce 'moving!' and his team will move to the next covered position in the direction of the bound.

player creatediaryrecord ["tier3",["Battle Positions","
A battle position is a group of individual fighting positions in a squad’s position in a defense or ambush.
Each fighting position should be mutually supportive of adjacent positions.
Squad leaders may consider personally placing squad autoriflemen in positions when moving into a battle position to ensure their maximum safety and effectiveness.
During an ambush, sectors of fire should be oriented on the ambush engagement area.
When in the defense, all personnel should be completely covered from enemy advance and should only fire to the obliques of their cover, never peeking out from behind or over their cover.

player creatediaryrecord ["tier3",["Route Selection","
Squad leaders should direct squad movement without micromanaging team leaders.
Movement should be directed to be as safe as is practical at all times.
Always choose the most covered and concealed route to an objective and when contact is likely, ensure that teams bound in short sprints that get from cover to cover as quickly as possible.
Squad leaders should ensure that subordinate elements are never more than a two second sprint from hard cover.

Specific circumstances call for alternate loadouts:
<br/>
Any night operation should substitute chemlights for smoke grenades.

Elements assigned to breach an obstacle should equip mine detectors and small explosive charges.

Heavy Combat Load
Heavy loads are for when you are making a permanent change of station or if you are defending an area and won’t need to move too far.
<br/>
Heavy loads are similar to light loads, except with twice the munitions and two extra autorifle belts per element member.
"]];

player creatediaryrecord ["gear",["Medium Loadout","
Medium combat loads are for accomplishing missions with lots of firepower. Medium loadouts are for missions that will be lengthy, when heavy contact is expected, or for squads in supporting or security roles of an attack.

Medium combat loads are similar to light combat loads, but with with roughly fifty percent more of each type of munition, plus one extra autorifle belt each loaded into an assault pack.

Minimum Size: Squad
<br/>
Purpose: Reconnaissance serves to gain information about an area, enemy, or objective.
<br/><br/>
Types of reconnaissance:
<br/>
Area - observe terrain or enemy activity within a designated area.
<br/>
Route - observe a specific route and any terrain from which the enemy could influence that route.
<br/>
Objective - observe a specific location in preparation for an action on that location.
<br/><br/>
Methods:
<br/>
<font size='18'>Fan</font>
<br/>
1. The patrol is organized into two recon elements and a reserve element.
<br/>
2. The patrol leader selects a series of rally points throughout the target area.
<br/>
3. The patrol secures a rally point.
<br/>
4. Reserves standby while recon teams move outward along overlapping, fan shaped routes.
<br/>
5. When all recon teams have returned, all information is pooled and shared.
<br/>
6. Once information is shared, the patrol moves to the next rally point.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>Box</font>
<br/>
1. The patrol is organized into three recon elements.
<br/>
2. The patrol leader selects a series of rally points throughout the target area.
<br/>
3. The patrol secures a rally point.
<br/>
4. Each element leaves the rally point along a different route.<br/>5. The patrol consolidates on the next rally point.
<br/>
6. Elements share information, then move out again.
<br/><br/>

<font size='18'>Surveillance</font>
<br/>
1. The patrol is organized into multiple recon elements and a reserve element.
<br/>
2. The patrol leader selects potential observation posts/OPs throughout an area.
<br/>
3. The patrol leader selects a safe, central rally point.
<br/>
4. The patrol secures the rally point.
<br/>
5. Recon elements are released to move to their observation posts/OPs.
<br/>
6. Reserves stand by.
<br/>
7. If an observation post/OP is discovered, recon elements consolidate on the rally point while the reserve element moves to assist in breaking contact, then the patrol returns to friendly lines.
<br/><br/>
Executing reconnaissance patrols:
<br/>
1. Designate areas to be surveyed.
<br/>
2. Designate rally points or observation posts/OPs.
<br/>
